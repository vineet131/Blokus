- Rotation and flipping of pieces drifts
- Sometimes when a piece is placed on the board near the edge of the board but the piece coordinates
  exceed the board, the green margin lingers on the board
- return_all_pending_moves() still missing out on some moves, likely due to check_is_move_valid()
  but can't be sure so I must investigate
- Selection of pieces could use some improvement (Area of selection is narrow)
